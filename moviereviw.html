    <p>Natural Star Nani has now come up with the romantic drama,
         Hi Nanna. The movie stars Mrunal Thakur and Baby Kaira Khanna 
         in vital roles. It is directed by debutant Shouryuv. We have
          been to a special premiere and let’s see how the film is.</p>
          <p><b>Story:</b></p>
          <p>Viraj (Nani) is a professional photographer. He is a single 
            parent taking care of his 6-year-old daughter Mahii (Baby Kaira Khanna).
             No matter how many times Mahii asks Viraj about her mother, the latter 
             never says anything. At last, Viraj agrees to talk about his wife only if 
             Mahii scores the first rank. Mahii does that, but Viraj doesn’t keep his word. 
             Irritated by this, the little girl leaves the home. Yashna (Mrunal Thakur) saves 
             Mahii from an accident. How Yashna changes the lives of Viraj and Mahii is what the film is about.</p>
    <p><b>Plus Points:</b></p>
    <p>Hi Nanna has a very good storyline with a solid scope for drama and emotions. Mrunal Thakur’s role is the heart and soul of the film. It is designed well, and the actress impresses with her script choice once again after Sita Ramam. Performance-wise, Mrunal Thakur did a fabulous job. Debutant Shouryuv handled a few emotional blocks in a neat manner. Along with the emotional moments, a couple of twists add value to the proceedings.</p>
     <p>Characters like Viraj are a walk in the park for Nani, and the actor once again melts hearts with his heart-touching performance. There is this beautiful scene in the film where Nani talks to the heroine’s mother. This is a small example to show what a natural performer Nani is. His chemistry with Mrunal is superb.</p>
    <p><b>Minus Points:</b></p>
    <p>The initial portions of the love story aren’t great and are a bit routine. Though there are good songs, the writing could have been better here. The movie gains momentum from the pre-interval sequence. Hi Nanna takes time to grow on us, and it is mainly due to the pacing.</p>
    <p>The movie will connect well to A center audiences, but that might not be the case with the masses. Shruti Haasan’s song in the second half seems out of place and could have been avoided. An important scene that comes after this special song should have been a banger, but the execution wasn’t satisfactory. The coherence is slightly missing in the proceedings in the second hour.</p>
    <p><b>Technical Aspects:</b></p>
    <p>Hesham Abdul Wahab’s songs and background score are wonderful. The only downside is the Odiyamma song, which wasn’t absolutely necessary. The visuals by Sanu John Varghese are splendid, and so are the production values. The editing is just okay.</p>
    <p>Coming to the director, Shouryuv, he did a decent job with his debut film. The storyline is interesting, and the dialogues have good depth. Shouryuv’s narrative is slow, but the movie has some good emotional scenes. He extracted very good performances from the actors. The movie’s length could have been shortened.</p>
    <p><b>Verdict:</b></p>
    <p>On the whole, Hi Nanna is a decent family drama that has some good emotional moments. Nani, Mrunal Thakur, and Baby Kiara Khanna are good in their respective roles. The storyline and songs are the biggest assets of Hi Nanna. However, the pacing is a bit slow, and the movie might not be overwhelming to the mass audience. A few portions needed a better presentation. If you love watching emotional dramas, you can comfortably watch this film this weekend.</p>
